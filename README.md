# COVID_flipr_hackathon
1. COVID-19 prediction of infected person on 20 March 
2. using time series 1D CNN + LSTM model to predict on 27 March
The Diuresis of a person is a time-dependent parameter, for which you have to come up with a Time-series prediction model

 Training_data.xlsx :  This is the training dataset on which model has to be trained, which contains parameters of a person on 20th March 2020 
 
 Test_data.xlsx :  This is the test data on which accuracy of the model will be computed
